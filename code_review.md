## Clean Code:
* Remember to break for loops where you reach a desired condition (e.g. during feature 9 extraction)
* Follows PEP-8

## Good Documentation:
* Effective use of docstrings and clear comments
* Explain your analysis or conclusion

## Proper Data Science:
* Ambitious use of NLP, though I'd consider applying some kind of dimensionality reduction (covered in project 4) rather than trying to extract information from raw word frequency
* 300 articles may be a little sparse for this problem
* Consider taking some time to further filter down your selected features
* Looks like significant heteroskedasticity is present in the final model

## Comments:
* Consider adjusting the print statement (sometimes called verbosity) rate in your functions to avoid excessively long loop logging outputs
